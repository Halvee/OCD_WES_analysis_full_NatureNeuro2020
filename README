The code contained here was used in the Halvorsen et al. analysis of OCD exomes
that was submitted to Nature Neuroscience journal. We have not included large
sample-level input data here, but rather are showing code used to generate
analysis results, figures and tables within the manuscript. 

The steps in running the analysis code were as follows:

00.input.sh : 
Build input data required for analysis.

01.run_clps_rate_analysis.sh :
Call the Rscript 01.run_clps_rate_analysis.R, which analyzes the burden of LoF
variants in a European case/control cohort, specifically all OCD cases from the
cohort against the subset of controls that are listed as 'control' or 
'healthy family member'. 

02.build_mut_rate_tbls.sh :
Build tables of mutation rate per annotation per single protein-coding gene in
the exome. 

03.trio_coverage.sh : 
Compile the number of trios jointly covered at least 10x over each individual
CCDS base. Combine this information with annotation information and base-level
mutation rate to get the expected mutation rate for 587 OCD trios for each
gene/annotation.

04.dnm_casectrl_prepare.sh :
Provide the same annotations to both cases and controls (GRCh37.87, CCDS
r20 transcripts only). Remove variants that have MAF > 0.0005 in a gnomAD
global or subpopulation cohort. For each variant, mark whether or not it falls
within loci that are well-covered (>=90% with at least 10x cov) in both trio cases 
and external samples on the same Roche EZCap V2 kit as control trios.

05.dnm_rate_caco.sh :
Call the Rscript 05.dnm_rate_caco.R, which assesses :
1) DNM rate summary statistics across OCD trios
2) the observed DNM rate per annotation versus expectation, based on DNM calls
from 1911 control trios and from expected mutation rate based on sequence
content and trio coverage.
3) observed/expected DNM rate of LoF mutations in LOEUF bins.
4) Case/control comparison of the burden of missense variants that are absent
from gnomAD, stratified across MPC bins (0-1, 1-2, >2).
5) observed/expected rate of MisD/LoF mutations in neurodevelopmental disorder
genes, TS probable risk genes.
6) LoF DNM burden stratified by annotation (stopgain, splice, frameshift)

06.dnm_genebased.sh :
Call the Rscript 06.dnm_genebased.R, which conducts one-sided poisson tests of
observed versus expected MisD/LoF mutation rate in single protein-coding genes
across a combined cohort of 771 trios (587 from this study, 184 from 
Cappi et al. 2019).

07.prep_extTADA.sh : 
Call the Rscript 07.prep_extTADA.R, which builds an input table of gene-based
counts of DNMs and case/control qualified variants that is passed to extTADA.

08.run_extTADA.sh :
Calls the Rscript 08.run_extTADA.R, which conducts extTADA analysis on input
gene-based DNM and case/control qualified variant counts.

09.clinical.sh :
Calls the Rscript 09.clinical.R, which tests for an association between the
presence of at least one damaging de novo mutation (LoF in gene with LOEUF<10%,
or MisD with MPC>2) and 4 seperate binary clinical traits. Afterwards, runs a
supplemental LoF rate comparison in non-trio OCD cases to compare rates in male
versus female cases, using the previously utilized Rscript
01.run_clps_rate_analysis.R.

10.misc.sh : 
Generate additional figures and tables which may have been requested as
supplemental figures and tables.

11.mainfigures.sh :
Compile the set of main figure PDFs used in the manuscript.

12.suppfigures.sh : 
Compile the set of supplemental figure PDFs used in the manuscript. Roll the
figures into a single docx file, along with figure captions. Page numbers and
table of contents are manually added to docx file afterwards.

13.supptables.sh :
Compile the set of supplemental table CSVs used in the manuscript. Roll the
tables into a single xlsx file, along with table legends.
